        <p>We'll send you documents and notices electronically. Please read this and check the box below if you agree.</p>

        <h5>Getting Paper Copies</h5>
        <p>You can download and print documents during signing. If you have an account, documents stay available for 30 days.
        Need paper copies later? Contact us and we'll mail them at no charge.</p>

        <h5>Switching to Paper</h5>
        <p>You can stop electronic delivery anytime. Just contact us. Paper delivery takes longer. You won't be able to sign electronically anymore.</p>

        <h5>How It Works</h5>
        <p>We send everything electronically unless you ask for paper. This includes all required notices and documents.
        Pick one delivery method so nothing gets missed.</p>

        <h5>Making Changes</h5>
        <p>Contact us to update your email address, request paper copies, or stop electronic delivery.</p>

        <h5>Stopping Electronic Delivery</h5>
        <p>During signing: Decline the document and check the box to withdraw consent on the next page.
        Anytime: Contact us with your name, email, mailing address, and phone number. Paper delivery will slow things down.</p>
