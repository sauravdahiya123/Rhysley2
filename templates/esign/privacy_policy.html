                        <h3><strong>What This Document Explains</strong></h3>
                        <p>Welcome to EazeeSign. We believe protecting your private information is fundamental to earning your trust. This notice explains how EazeeSign, Inc. (“EazeeSign,” “we,” “us”) gathers, uses, and protects your personal information. This applies when you use our websites (like eazeesign.com), our mobile apps, or any of our services that link to this notice (our “Services”).</p>

                        <p>When you use our Services, you are acknowledging our methods for handling your information as we've laid them out here.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes, we handle your information because of a deal we have with another company, like your employer. If you think another organization asked us to manage your information (for example, they sent you a document to sign), you should contact them first. They are the ones in charge of your data in that situation. This notice doesn't cover other websites or apps you might visit, even if we link to them. It's a good idea to check their own privacy policies.</p>

                        <p>Our main service helps you complete and prove the validity of digital transactions. This could be signing a rental agreement or putting a digital signature on a new-hire form. To make this work, we need to collect and record details that prove the transaction happened, like the names of people involved and the devices they used.</p>

                        <p>We recommend reading this entire notice to be fully informed. You can also use the sections below to jump to the information you need.</p>

                        <h3><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">You get to decide what information you give us. Just know that some parts of our Services won't work without certain details. For instance, you can't sign a document without giving us your name and creating a signature.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Information You Give Us</strong></h4>
                        <p>You directly provide us with information about yourself when you do things like:</p>

                        <p>You might also give us information about other people. This happens when you:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="pb-1">Send a document to someone else to sign.</li>

                        <p>Your computer and devices tell us some things automatically when you use our Services. We collect this information even if you're just visiting our website without logging in.</p>

                        <p>This includes:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="pb-1"><strong>Device Details:</strong> Your IP address, device model, operating system, and the type of web browser you're using.</li>

                            <li class="pb-1"><strong>Transaction Details:</strong> We keep a secure audit log for every transaction. This log shows who did what and when, such as reviewing or signing a document. It also includes the IP addresses of the people involved to help confirm the document’s integrity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="mb-4">We capture some of this automatic information using cookies and similar tools.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Information from Others</strong></h3>

                        <p>We may get information about you from other places.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="pb-1"><strong>Other EazeeSign Users:</strong> A user might give us your name and email to ask for your signature on a document.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="pb-1"><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use other companies to help us run our business. This includes cloud hosting providers, payment processors, and customer support tools. They are only allowed to use your information to perform the task we hired them for.</li>
                            <li class="pb-1"><strong>Affiliates:</strong> We may share information with companies that are part of the EazeeSign corporate family.</li>
                            <li class="pb-1"><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> On our marketing websites, we may allow ad partners to use cookies to show you relevant ads on other sites. This does not happen inside our core e-signature product. We never share the content of your documents with ad partners.</li>
                            <li class="pb-1"><strong>Government or Legal Authorities:</strong> We will share information if the law requires it, such as for a court order, or to protect anyone’s physical safety.</li>

                        <p>We keep your information only as long as we need it for the purpose it was collected. The specific time depends on why we have it and any legal rules we must follow. For instance, we hold onto the details of a signed document for many years to maintain its legal validity. When we no longer need information, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4"><strong>5. Your Choices</strong></h3>
                        <p>You always have choices about how your information is used.</p>
